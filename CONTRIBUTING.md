# Contributing

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing to the RACTF Infrastructure. As an open-source first project, we really appreciate any and all assistance that people are gracious enough to provide. That being said, this repository is different to the other ones on our GitHub, as rather than being a collaborative project, this repository reflects the Infrastructure decisions the RACTF team has made. If you haven't specifically discussed an idea for this repo with a member of the team, there is a good change the Pull Request will be rejected. This is not a position we would normally select, but as everything in this repository constitutes a billable resource, we have to be careful about what exactly is deployed. For this reason, we recommend discussing your pull request with a member of the team before creating it, or limiting your changes to documentation.
